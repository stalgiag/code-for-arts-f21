#### During Class
- Introductions
- Course Overview
- Programming for Artists Overview Lecture
- Overview of Tools for Semester Work
- Tutorial on Drawing & Coordinate System

#### Before Next Class
- Join the Discord channel (see email for link). Make a username that is not your legal name (for FERPA reasons) but kind of resembles it (so we can tell who is who). 
  - This is where you will submit your work for the course
  - You can also work on projects with your peers here.

- Read [Coordinate System and Shapes](https://p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html)
- Follow Along with Coding Train Videos:
  - [Web Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXs1cOlidWs)
  - [Shapes and Drawing](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/p5js/1.3-shapes-and-drawing.html)
  - [Color](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/p5js/1.4-color.html)
  - [Code Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJcrPJuem5Q)

- Create and Upload Exercise 1: Still Life
  - Make an an account on the [p5 web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/signup).
  - Assemble a still-life in your workspace
  - This can be an arrangement of a few simple objects, anything is okay
  - Try to "draw" the still life in p5.js using what you learned in class and by watching the videos
  - Don't worry about details. The goal isn't to spend a ton of time writing hundreds of lines of code but instead to find large shapes and think about the computer as also space of 'flattening' in much the same way as drawing.
  - Feel free to explore other drawing functions in the `2D Primitives` section of [the reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
  - After you have finished, go to `File->Share` and copy the 'Present' link; go to the class Discord and navigate into the ‘exercises’ channel, add your 'Present' link as a post along with the title of the piece.
